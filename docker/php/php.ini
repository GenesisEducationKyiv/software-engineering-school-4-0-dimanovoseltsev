; **Error Reporting:**
error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE                 ; Report all errors except notices

; **Display Errors:**
display_errors = On                                  ; Enable error display in development
log_errors = Off                                    ; Don't log errors in development (optional)

; **Strict Mode:**
zend.strict_mode = 1                                 ; Enable strict mode for enhanced error checking

; **Performance Optimization:**
opcache.enabled = 0                                 ; Disable OPcache in development for faster code changes (optional)

; **Security:**
allow_url_fopen = On                                   ; Allow for easier testing and debugging (adjust based on security needs)
allow_url_include = Off                             ; Disable remote file inclusion
register_globals = Off                            ; Prevent automatic registration of GET/POST/COOKIE/SERVER variables
magic_quotes_gpc = Off                            ; Disable magic quotes for security reasons

; **Other Recommendations:**
max_execution_time = 300                          ; Set a maximum execution time for scripts to prevent infinite loops
post_max_size = 20M                                 ; Set a maximum upload size for POST requests
upload_max_filesize = 20M                          ; Set a maximum upload size for individual files
